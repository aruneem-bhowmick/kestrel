# kestrel

## Install (dev)

```sh
git clone https://github.com/aruneem-bhowmick/kestrel.git
cd kestrel
uv sync
uv run pytest -m "not live and not e2e"
```

## Configuration

Kestrel reads settings from `kestrel.toml`. On startup it checks, in
order, an explicit `--config` path, `$KESTREL_CONFIG`, `./kestrel.toml`,
and a per-user config directory, stopping at the first one it finds; if
none exist it falls back to built-in defaults. Files are never merged
across these layers. See `src/kestrel/data/kestrel.default.toml` for every
recognized key and its default value. Secrets (API keys, tokens,
passwords) must never be placed in this file -- set them as environment
variables instead.
