# kestrel

## Install (dev)

```sh
git clone https://github.com/aruneem-bhowmick/kestrel.git
cd kestrel
uv sync
uv run pytest -m "not live and not e2e"
```

## Configuration

Kestrel reads settings from `kestrel.toml`. On startup it checks, in
order, an explicit `--config` path, `$KESTREL_CONFIG`, `./kestrel.toml`,
and a per-user config directory, stopping at the first one it finds; if
none exist it falls back to built-in defaults. Files are never merged
across these layers. See `src/kestrel/data/kestrel.default.toml` for every
recognized key and its default value. Secrets (API keys, tokens,
passwords) must never be placed in this file -- set them as environment
variables instead.

## Models

Available models live in `models.toml`, an array of `[[models]]` tables
each naming a Kestrel-stable id, backend, provider-side model name, and
USD-per-million-token rates. On startup Kestrel checks, in order, an
explicit registry path passed to `load_registry()`, `./models.toml`, and
a per-user config directory, stopping at the first one it finds; if none
exist it falls back to the registry bundled with the package
(`src/kestrel/data/models.default.toml`), which ships two GLM-5.2 routes
(OpenRouter and Z.ai direct). Files are never merged across these layers.
Every entry is validated at load time; misconfigured entries fail with a
message naming the file, the entry, and the field at fault.

## Provider layer

Every backend adapter implements one interface,
`kestrel.provider.ProviderClient.complete()`, and streams a normalized
event sequence rather than its own wire format: zero or more
`TextDelta`/`ToolCallEvent` events, then exactly one `UsageEvent`, then
exactly one `StopEvent` as the final event --
`kestrel.provider.validate_stream_order()` checks a sequence against this
grammar. On failure, a call raises a typed `ProviderError` subclass
(`AuthError`, `RateLimitError`, `ContextOverflowError`, `ServerError`)
naming the active model id and backend, instead of emitting a stop event.
No call site outside an adapter names a vendor.
